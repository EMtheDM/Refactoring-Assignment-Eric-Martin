# 01-Refactoring Assignment - Eric Martin
## Description
I refactored the HTML and CSS for this website. The motiviation was to clean up the code. Doing so allowed the site to become more semantic, and highly accessible. Being highly accessible solved problems that may arise should someone utilizing accessibility features on their browser causing confusion and provide a less than ideal experience. I learned that when coding in HTML, we can't just use the div element, but need to be more specific in order to make the site accessible to those with disabilities.
